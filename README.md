# RubiksCubeSolver
In this project, I created a rubiks cube solver that takes a rubix cube, randomizes wtihin 50 steps, and then solves the cube within 50 steps.
The IDE I used to develop and run the program is Processing. You can test and run the code on this IDE and you will be provided with a 
simulation. I programmed the cube to rotate at a speed of 0.2. To test the code, run the program on Processing and then press the 
's' key on your keyboard ('s' represents start). 

The speed and number of of moves can be adusted within the RubiksCube file. The start button 's' can be changed and is located within the
controls file. During execution, the cube is randomized with a set pattern and then solves it self by performing the reversal of the input 
set of instructions.
